# Celia Sallet Graphic Designer/Web Developer

#### Hey I'm a graphic designer and visual artist who got hooked on coding while working on installations. I tend to nerd out big time when it comes to my passions, it sparked this thirst to learn more.
 
#### ***Super stoked for this training journey !***


### My suprising skills

1. I can write with both hands
2. Make a chair out of a champain cork
3. Speak in *I* and *Vedegue-vagada*

### My favorite things on earth

- My rabbit **Mouchette**
- A Nice Gueuze
- Fresh seafood by the beach 

## My objectives in Becode

I want to gain confidence in my skills, solve problems indepently, and know 
where to look for solutions. I aim to achieve maximum autonomy by the end 
of the training and secure a position in a 360Â° digital agency. 

### My fears 

As I can get a bit obsessed, my only fear would be to get crazy on one 
error for exemple and not being able to step back and solve it with a fresh 
perspective. 

***Looking forward to be skilled enough to finaly get my dream job !***

### Things I value the most as a team 

+ *Communication, letting everyone share their ideas equally*
+ *Sharing good vibes and respecting each other*
+ *Working at the same pace and helping one another if it's not the case*
